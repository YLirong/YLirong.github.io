<p class="center">The artworks are all produced in digital. They are created when I started exploring my major (Digital Media Art). Each piece shows a new content that the major has included. These works are made using different software, such as Photoshop, Adobe illustrator, Audacity, Atom, and GitHub. The inspiration for my work was to add some elements that represent my character and hobbies. </p>

<p class="center">I </span>like the beauty of fairy tales. quiet, simple and elegant style. I like to find beauty in ordinary things. These works show these traces. So the color I chose to make the work is bright. These works show things I enjoy in life and imagine some wonderful things. These works deliver wonderful energy.</p>
