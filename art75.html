<h3>About</h3>
<p class="center">I explored more about how to make videos and coding in the classroom (Intro Digital Video). My work uses Adobe Premiere to make videos. In addition to this, there is also a programming website.
My idea is to add my favorite fairy tale style elements in my design. Therefore, I use animal pandas to represent humans, or in an implicit way, to present what I experience and see in life. </p>

  <h3>"Camera?", Digital Video, 1:23min</h3>
  <p>This work is showing a culture issue, my theme is misuse of technology. I compare the two ways to use the camera. The first part of the video shows people enjoying the good life with a camera. The other part, in an implicit way, shows people's privacy violations by cameras. </p>

     <h3>“Flipbook”, Installation Art, 2min, 2019</h3>
  <p>The process of creating this work simulates the presentation and installation into the creation. My idea is to grow up, the album represents memory, and I present the work in the form of a book, like a projection into a book. I use the panda as the protagonist to represent humanity.</p>

      <p>
  I chose the two most impressive activities I used to play on my computer in my childhood. I rebuild my earliest internet memory with the most representative elements of the two.
