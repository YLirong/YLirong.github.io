<h3>About</h3>
<p class="center">I was influenced by storybooks that I liked as a kid. Telling stories in simple language and telling interesting stories taught a lot of truth. I like to make works that bring joy and energy. My works have video art and website. The idea of my work comes from my exploration of life. I like to add some elements of tales to express what I think and see.</p>
<p>From my inspiration, I like to use animals as protagonists, or make abstract works, which implicitly represent something. In the first work, I used an abstract method to show a social problem, reducing the sense of horror and making the work hit the point. The second work is growth. I use a childish approach to show that life is beautiful. For the last two works, I also made them cheerful.

  <h3>"Camera?", Digital Video, 1:23min</h3>
  <p>This work is showing a culture issue, my theme is misuse of technology. I compare the two ways to use the camera. The first part of the video shows people enjoying the good life with a camera. The other part, in an implicit way, shows people's privacy violations by cameras. </p>

     <h3>“Flipbook”, Installation Art, 2min, 2019</h3>
  <p>The process of creating this work simulates the presentation and installation into the creation. My idea is to grow up, the album represents memory, and I present the work in the form of a book, like a projection into a book. I use the panda as the protagonist to represent humanity.</p>
