  <h3>“Space Adventure”, Code Art using p5.js, 2019
</h3>
  <p>
The idea is that people go to the Galaxy to travel and explore. Because this project is going to be a surreal world, The background is dreamy. People take a flying(bouncing) sailboat, avoiding some obstacles, a mirage (B&W door), the shooting stars, and a floating planet. Find the right door (pink door) that opens the new world. Move the mouse while clicking the mouse to see the hidden planets and the interchangeable door.
